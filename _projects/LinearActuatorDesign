Project: Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of fixed length (your choice), 
3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator (pick from online catalog, 
use max force values only), design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possibel weight for the heighest 
possible height. Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.


Chosen Actuator: ERD rod style actuator
Max force: 2kN
Stroke length: 0.6m (can only use 0.5m due to given design space)

Idea: Build a mechanism that translates motion of actuator to upwards motion of bar)
